### Developing Applications w/Google Cloud: Foundations

- Cloud development allows for (full) scalability[1], high availability, reduced costs, global access(?)

Best Practices
- allow for **scalability, high availability, security, 'global access'** (these are minimal standarsd, 'table stakes' (poker term?))
- **data isolation to a specific region** for security or compliance reasons
- store code in a **code repository**
- **use dependency manager** to manage dependencies
  - list dependencies and versions in the project
  - lean on dep mgr (maven, npm, nuget) to pull down those dependencies, manage versions, etc
- store **configuration settings** outside of your code as environment variables
  - allows environments the code is running in to dictate configuration
- scope of applications should be considered as features are added
  - applications should be as single-minded in purpose as possible
  - one benefit is being able to scale
  - example:
    - currently pup app backend is an interface for order data between our data store and the FE
    - if we started to support, for example, diverting orders to a customer's orders and we had to build an API to support this, there'd be a good argument for branching this off into another service.
      - you'd be able to scale this differently than the original (for example, if only a few stores supported this feature, and the pup app spread to 50 PUPs, if these 2 services are separate microservices, you could scale the BE that supports orders wihtout having to also scale the order-diversion service) 
  - consider the costs and benefits of refactoring a monolithic app to two or more microservices, because the effort to break them out, test and fix bugs can be significant, but the long-term benefits can also be significant
- keep operations in the **user thread** to a minimum
- perform backend operations **asynchronously**
- use **event-driven processing** whenever possible
  - example async process: processing uploaded images
    - upload images to bucket storage
    - create an image-processing cloud-run function that is triggered when an image is added to bucket storage
- **tightly-coupled components can make an application less resilient to failures, spikes in traffic, and changes to services**
- event/message queues can be used to implement
    - loose coupling,
    - perform asynchronous processing, and
    - buffer requests if traffic spikes
    - examples:
      - loose coupling: 
      - perform asynchronous processing, and
      - buffer requests if traffic spikes

- accessing a commonly **shared state** can be a bottleneck
